### Basic Navigation

Why Use the Terminal?
The terminal is powerful, fast, and gives you full control over your system. GUI is like automatic ‚Äî terminal is manual ‚Äî but gives you more precision.

### üñ•Ô∏è Terminal Basics
Command	What It Does
- `pwd`:  Print current directory (where you are)
- `ls`:List files in current directory
- `cd <dir> `:Change directory
- `mkdir <dir>`:Make a new directory
- `touch <file>	`: Create a new file
- `cp <src> <dest>`:Copy files
- `mv <src> <dest>`:Move/rename files
- `rm <file>`:Delete files
  
 Add -r  for directories

### Getting Help

Command	Use
- `man <command>`:Open manual page
- `<command> --help`:Get usage summary

Example:
```
man ls
ls --help
```

### üìÇ File System Structure 
Folder	Purpose
- /	       Root of the system
- /home	   User folders
- /etc	   Configuration files
- /bin  	 Essential system binaries (e.g. ls, cp)
- /var	   Logs, variable files (e.g. /var/log)

### üîê Permissions & Ownership
Check file permissions:
- ```ls -l```
Example:

```-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 123 Jul 3 10:00 file.txt```

Breakdown:

rwx: Read, write, execute

3 sets: Owner / Group / Others
sample:  -rwxrwxrwx

![alt text](image.png)

File permission numbers
| Permission  | Binary | Decimal |
| ----------- | ------ | ------- |
| `r` (read)  | `100`  | **4**   |
| `w` (write) | `010`  | **2**   |
| `x` (exec)  | `001`  | **1**   |

You add these together for each set of permissions

| Permissions | Binary | Decimal       |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------- |
| `rwx`       | `111`  | 4+2+1 = **7** |
| `rw-`       | `110`  | 4+2+0 = **6** |
| `r--`       | `100`  | 4+0+0 = **4** |
| `r-x`       | `101`  | 4+0+1 = **5** |
| `--x`       | `001`  | 0+0+1 = **1** |

ie - rwx rwx rwx
   7   7   7  ‚Üí 777

Change permissions:
```
 chmod 755 file.sh
```
Change owner:
```
chown <username>:<groupname> file.txt

```
Run with admin rights:

sudo command

### üì¶ Package Management
Depending on the distro:
Distro: Install	Remove	Update
- Ubuntu/Debian
  ```
  sudo apt install <pkg>
  sudo apt remove <pkg>
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade ```
- Fedora
  ```
  sudo dnf install <pkg>
  sudo dnf remove <pkg>
  sudo dnf update 
  ```
- Arch
  ```
  sudo pacman -S <pkg>
  sudo pacman -R <pkg>
  sudo pacman -Syu

  ```

Example:
```sudo apt install neofetch```

### Simple Scripting

Basic Bash script:
```sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, Linux!"
```
Save as hello.sh, then:

- ```chmod +x hello.sh```
- ```./hello.sh```

You can automate tasks like backups or updates with scripts.

üåê Networking Basics
Command	Use
- ```ping <host>	             Check network connection```
- ```ip a	                     Show IP addresses```
- ```curl <url>             	 Fetch content from web```
- ```scp file user@host:/path	 Secure copy over SSH```
- ``` ssh user@host	           Connect to another machine```

Example:
ping google.com
ssh student@192.168.1.100

### Navigation & Files

- `stat <file>`: Detailed file info (timestamps, size, etc.)
- `file <file>`:Tells you the file type
- `locate <name>`:	Quickly find files by name (use sudo updatedb first)
- `find . -name "*.txt"	`:Find files recursively by pattern
- `du -sh *`: Show disk usage of files/folders
