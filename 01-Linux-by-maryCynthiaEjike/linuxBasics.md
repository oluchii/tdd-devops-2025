These distributions offer a variety of features and target different audiences. Some distributions, such as Ubuntu and Mint, are designed to be user-friendly and easy to install. Other distributions, such as Arch Linux and Manjaro, are more geared towards power users who want to have more control over their system.
When choosing a Linux distribution, it is important to consider your needs and preferences. If you are new to Linux, it is recommended to start with a user-friendly distribution such as Ubuntu . Once you have become more familiar with Linux, you can try other distributions that offer more features or customization options.

### Basic Navigation

Why Use the Terminal?
The terminal is powerful, fast, and gives you full control over your system. GUI is like automatic — terminal is manual — but gives you more precision.

### 🖥️ Terminal Basics
Command	What It Does
- `pwd`:  Print current directory (where you are)
- `ls`:List files in current directory
- `cd <dir> `:Change directory
- `mkdir <dir>`:Make a new directory
- `touch <file>	`: Create a new file
- `cp <src> <dest>`:Copy files
- `mv <src> <dest>`:Move/rename files
- `rm <file>`:Delete files
  
 Add -r  for directories

### Getting Help

Command	Use
- `man <command>`:Open manual page
- `<command> --help`:Get usage summary

Example:
```
man ls
ls --help
```

### 📂 File System Structure 
Folder	Purpose
- /	       Root of the system
- /home	   User folders
- /etc	   Configuration files
- /bin  	 Essential system binaries (e.g. ls, cp)
- /var	   Logs, variable files (e.g. /var/log)

### 🔐 Permissions & Ownership
Check file permissions:
- ```ls -l```
Example:

```-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 123 Jul 3 10:00 file.txt```

Breakdown:

rwx: Read, write, execute

3 sets: Owner / Group / Others
sample:  -rwxrwxrwx

![alt text](image.png)

File permission numbers
| Permission  | Binary | Decimal |
| ----------- | ------ | ------- |
| `r` (read)  | `100`  | **4**   |
| `w` (write) | `010`  | **2**   |
| `x` (exec)  | `001`  | **1**   |

You add these together for each set of permissions

| Permissions | Binary | Decimal       |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------- |
| `rwx`       | `111`  | 4+2+1 = **7** |
| `rw-`       | `110`  | 4+2+0 = **6** |
| `r--`       | `100`  | 4+0+0 = **4** |
| `r-x`       | `101`  | 4+0+1 = **5** |
| `--x`       | `001`  | 0+0+1 = **1** |

ie - rwx rwx rwx
   7   7   7  → 777

Change permissions:
```
 chmod 755 file.sh
```
Change owner:
```
chown <username>:<groupname> file.txt

```
Run with admin rights:

sudo command

### 📦 Package Management
Depending on the distro:
Distro: Install	Remove	Update
- Ubuntu/Debian
  ```
  sudo apt install <pkg>
  sudo apt remove <pkg>
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade ```
- Fedora
  ```
  sudo dnf install <pkg>
  sudo dnf remove <pkg>
  sudo dnf update 
  ```
- Arch
  ```
  sudo pacman -S <pkg>
  sudo pacman -R <pkg>
  sudo pacman -Syu

  ```

Example:
```sudo apt install neofetch```

### Simple Scripting

Basic Bash script:
```sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, Linux!"
```
Save as hello.sh, then:

- ```chmod +x hello.sh```
- ```./hello.sh```

You can automate tasks like backups or updates with scripts.

🌐 Networking Basics
Command	Use
- ```ping <host>	             Check network connection```
- ```ip a	                     Show IP addresses```
- ```curl <url>             	 Fetch content from web```
- ```scp file user@host:/path	 Secure copy over SSH```
- ``` ssh user@host	           Connect to another machine```

Example:
ping google.com
ssh student@192.168.1.100

### Navigation & Files
- `tree`: Visual folder structure (install with   sudo apt install tree)
- `stat <file>`: Detailed file info (timestamps, size, etc.)
- `file <file>`:Tells you the file type
- `locate <name>`:	Quickly find files by name (use sudo updatedb first)
- `find . -name "*.txt"	`:Find files recursively by pattern
- `du -sh *`: Show disk usage of files/folders
- `df -h`: Show free space on mounted drives

###  User Management Commands
